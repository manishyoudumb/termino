Termino offers a decentralized, secure, and efficient way to communicate directly from your command line.
Built by developers, for developers who appreciate the beauty of pure code.


This project integrates multiple advanced technologies including WebRTC for real-time communication, IPFS for decentralized storage, and libp2p for peer-to-peer networking. Termino is designed for developers who value privacy, security, and the elegance of terminal-based applications.

With Termino, you can:
- Send encrypted messages directly between peers
- Share files through decentralized storage
- Conduct secure audio/video calls
- Manage blockchain-based authentication
- Enjoy end-to-end encryption for all communications

Whether you're a blockchain enthusiast, a privacy advocate, or just love working in the terminal, Termino brings modern communication technologies to your fingertips in a way that's both powerful and developer-friendly.


## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Rust (because we like our code fast and safe)
- **UI Framework**: TUI-rs with Crossterm backend (terminal is the new black)
- **Networking**: libp2p (the backbone of Web3)
